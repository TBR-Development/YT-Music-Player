I got tired of having a browser tab open just to play YouTube Music. So I created this little menubar [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application _(inspired by [rosswaycaster/XM-Menu-Player][XMMenuPlayer])_ that wraps YouTube Music. Enjoy! üé∂

2. Check the `out` folder for the packaged application to run.

**Notes**

If you want to package a squirrel based app/installer, you can use `yarn make`. Once done check the `out/make` folder for your new squirrel based app/installer.

Windows and linux users can use `Control+X` or `Command+X` to quit the app.
MacOS users can use `CMD+Q` to quit the app.
