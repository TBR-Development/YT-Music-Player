I got tired of having a browser tab open just to play YouTube Music. So I created this little menu bar [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application *(inspired by [rosswaycaster/XM-Menu-Player][XMMenuPlayer])* that wraps YouTube Music. It also displays the current artist and song title in the menu bar. Enjoy! 🎶
